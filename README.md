Q1: Change Paragraph Content
Objective:
The goal of this exercise is to demonstrate how to manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model) using JavaScript. When the user clicks the button, the content of the paragraph with the ID text is changed.

Key Concepts:
DOM Manipulation: We use JavaScript to interact with and modify the content of HTML elements.
Event Handling: The button triggers a function changeText() on click to update the paragraph content.
Rubric Application:
Use of Functions (5/5): The code defines and uses reusable functions like updateContent() and changeText(), making the code modular and easy to maintain.
Use of For Loops (N/A): No loops were required in this exercise as the task was focused on DOM manipulation.
Code Quality (4/5): The code is structured with meaningful function names and clear intent, though minor improvements in code organization could be made for scalability.
Q2: Input Validation
Objective:
This exercise focuses on validating user input. The goal is to check if the entered value is a number, and if it is, compare it with 10 using an if-else condition. Depending on the result, the user will receive an alert indicating whether the number is lower or higher than 10.

Key Concepts:
Input Validation: JavaScript is used to ensure that the input is numeric before performing any operations.
Conditionals: The use of if-else statements helps compare the input against a predefined value (10).
Error Handling: Alerts are displayed if the input is invalid, guiding the user to enter a valid number.
Rubric Application:
Use of Functions (5/5): The solution uses multiple functions such as validateAndCheckInput(), isNumber(), and checkNumberRange() to handle different tasks. This modular approach improves code readability and reusability.
Use of For Loops (N/A): No loops were required for input validation in this exercise.
Code Quality (5/5): The code is well-structured and easy to understand. It follows best practices, with proper function names and a clear flow.
Q3: Display Numbers Using For Loop
Objective:
This exercise demonstrates how to use a for loop to display numbers from 1 to a specified limit. The numbers are dynamically generated and displayed in an HTML paragraph element.

Key Concepts:
Loops: A for loop is used to iterate from 1 to a specified limit, adding the number to a string that is then displayed in the HTML.
Dynamic Content: The output is dynamically updated in the browser without reloading the page, showcasing how JavaScript can manipulate HTML content.
Rubric Application:
Use of Functions (5/5): The function displayNumbers() is used to generate and display numbers. It makes the code reusable and clean.
Use of For Loops (6/6): The exercise uses a for loop efficiently to generate and display the numbers, meeting the rubricâ€™s expectations.
Code Quality (4/5): The code is simple, with minor improvements needed for scalability, but overall clear and easy to follow.
How to Run the Code
Clone or download this repository.
Open the HTML files in your browser directly, or use a local server (such as XAMPP or Live Server) to test the functionality.
Interact with the functionalities (click buttons, enter numbers, etc.) as demonstrated in the code.
Conclusion
These exercises showcase the application of JavaScript in manipulating the DOM, handling events, validating inputs, and using loops to control program flow. They are structured to help learners understand fundamental JavaScript concepts and their practical application in web development.
